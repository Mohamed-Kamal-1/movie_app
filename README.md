## 🛠 Technology Stack

This project is built using a modern and robust set of tools within the Flutter ecosystem:

| Category | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Framework** | **[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)** | Cross-platform UI toolkit. |
| **Language** | **[Dart](https://dart.dev/)** | The core programming language for the application. |
| **State Management** | **[BLoC / Cubit](https://bloclibrary.dev/)** | A pattern for predictable and scalable state management. |
| **Networking** | **[Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio)** | A powerful HTTP client for executing **REST API** requests. |
| **Architecture** | **Clean Architecture** | The architectural blueprint for separating application layers. |
| **Dependency Injection** | **[GetIt](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it)** | A service locator used for easy access to shared services. |

## 📐 Project Architecture

The project adheres to the **Clean Architecture Pattern** to ensure a strong separation of concerns. The code is divided into key layers:

1.  **Presentation:** Contains the UI components and BLoC/Cubit files for managing screen state.
2.  **Domain:** Holds the core business logic, including Entities and Use Cases.
3.  **Data:** Manages the Repositories and Remote Data Sources for interacting with the external REST API.

This structure significantly improves the codebase's testability, maintainability, and long-term scalability.
